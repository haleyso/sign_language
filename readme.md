Just doing some learning about neural networks for sign language classification! This was originally done on colab, but I exported it to a jupyter notebook. 


Citing tools and sources for the code:
Tools used:
Google Colab, tensorflow, keras, seaborn, scipy, pandas, sklearn

Dataset:
MNIST Sign Language
